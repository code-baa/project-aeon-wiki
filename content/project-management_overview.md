#### ~~This will likely require us setting up a Raspberry Pi server with RPi Connect on it.~~ 
- ~~We can gather notes from here and compile them onto a wiki hosted page using [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build)~~ we don't really have a need to do this?

- [ ] Development / technical wiki
	- E.g weapon class
		- Firerate, primary/secondary/utility, damage, reload speed, mag size, mesh, sound effects, decals, particles, ADS speed, etc
	- We could categorize tasks easier by being able to link to task notes and have dependencies attached 
		- E.g in our roadmap we list picking up/dropping guns
			- This implies a rudimentary inventory system. This task page would list basic inventory as a pre-requisite. 
			- Likewise, the inventory system requires the above weapon class to be defined as a pre requisite
- [ ] Game ideas / game lore wiki
	- [ ] Curate game ideas, link ideas and thoughts to create a cohesive vision of the game on paper
